To run this program on any computer, you'll need to grab the number of input device for your controller or other input device. You can do that by running a specific command in your command line.
Using that same command, you'll want to choose your input device and run a series of tests to grab what code each button has. The code is the number associated when pressing the button.
For example, pressing the A button on my specific Xbox controller was associated with the value '304.' To tell whether the button has been pressed or release, the state will have a 1 for pressed and a 0 for released.
You'll need to change the values accordingly for your specific Xbox controller, and for any other input device as well. 
I didn't code the joysticks because there was so much data being sent in at once that it wasn't really feasible with the limitations I set on myself.
